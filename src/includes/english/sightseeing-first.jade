        | If&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;see everything in&nbsp;<nobr>Saint-Petersburg</nobr>&nbsp;&mdash; you should stay longer. Even a&nbsp;month might not be&nbsp;enough as&nbsp;you won’t&nbsp;see all of&nbsp;the hidden treasures of&nbsp;the city. It&nbsp;was built as&nbsp;an&nbsp;Imperial Capital and it&nbsp;is&nbsp;still living in&nbsp;those times sometimes. It&nbsp;has more museums than Rome, Paris and Amsterdam, more theatres than Berlin and the historical centre of&nbsp;the city is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the biggest <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/540">UNESCO objects</a>.
