  "readme": "# urlish\n\nThis is a simple module that parses an input string to determine if it\nmatches with a typical url syntax.  This is not a strict URL parser, and if\nthat behaviour is desired I would recommend looking at the core node\n[url](http://nodejs.org/api/url.html) module.\n\nThis module was written to satisfy the use case of\n[getit](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/getit) where url-like syntaxes\nare used.\n\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/urlish.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/urlish/)\n\n[![Build Status](https://drone.io/bitbucket.org/DamonOehlman/urlish/status.png)](https://drone.io/bitbucket.org/DamonOehlman/urlish/latest)\n\n## So what is URLish?\n\nIn very simple terms we are looking for something that matches the\nfollowing format:\n\n```\n[scheme]://[hostname](:[port])?(/[path])?\n```\n\nAt this stage, things like usernames and passwords are not looked at\nand no querystring or hash parsing is attempted either.\n\n## Example Usage\n\nThe following demonstrates the usage of `urlish` within the context\nof the `getit` module:\n\n```\nERROR: could not find: \n```\n\nIn the case above, you will notice that the hostname component is not\nautomatically lowercased as it is using the `url.parse` function. This is\nuseful when working with getit as we are using the host component to map\nto a part of a real url that is case-sensitive.\n\n## License(s)\n\n### MIT\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Damon Oehlman <damon.oehlman@gmail.com>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n",
